Some beginning users of [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/index.html) including myself, have started up a [Puget Sound QGIS User's Group](http://www.meetup.com/Puget-Sound-QGIS-Users-Group/).

We're just starting out. If you're interested in taming the power of GIS with open source software, QGIS is for you. It runs on Java, supporting Windows, Mac, and Linux.
