Experimenting with creating a blog using github pages. I'm not sure how it will work out.

I intend to write about usefull tips and discoveries I make for working with Geodata and open source software.

Thanks are due to Jonathan McGlone whose great [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) I credit with getting this blog up and running.
