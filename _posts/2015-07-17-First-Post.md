Experimenting with creating a blog using Github pages. I'm not sure how it will work out.

I intend to write about useful tips and discoveries I make for working with geodata and open source software.

Thanks are due to Jonathan McGlone whose great [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) I used to get this blog up and running.

I'm posting some older items migrated from the [Lazy M 8 page](www.lazym8.com). Just incase you were wondering why this isn't listed as the first post.
