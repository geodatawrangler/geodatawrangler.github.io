Working to solve a image processing problem, I found this enticing <a href="http://briantjacobs.com/mrsid-gdal-homebrew/>tutorial</a> from Brian T. Jacobs.

It's instructions to compile <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL</a> for OSX using <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> so it can read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MrSID:>MrSID</a> compressed images and <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//003n00000007000000">ESRI's File Geodatabase</a> vector data format.

I've had really nice experiences installing software with homebrew, but I understand that if you already using macports there can be conflicts.
