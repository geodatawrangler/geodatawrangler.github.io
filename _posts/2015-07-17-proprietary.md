Working to solve a image processing problem, I found this enticing [tutorial]( http://briantjacobs.com/mrsid-gdal-homebrew/) from Brian T. Jacobs.

It's instructions to compile [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) for OSX using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) so it can read [MrSID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MrSID) compressed images and [ESRI's File Geodatabase](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//003n00000007000000) vector data format.

I've had really nice experiences installing software with homebrew, but I understand that if you already using macports there can be conflicts.
