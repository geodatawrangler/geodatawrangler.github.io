Last night I shared a [presentation on Relations in QGIS 2.10](http://www.lazym8.com/datawrangler/qgis_relations) at the November [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Puget-Sound-QGIS-Users-Group/) of the [Puget Sound QGIS User's Group](http://psqgis.org).

The Puget Sound QGIS User's Group is a great group where we get together and learn how to use the various features of QGIS. We all pitch in to share what we know and learn more in a fun atmosphere.
