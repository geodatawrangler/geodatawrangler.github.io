I've got a new article about my trip to [State of the Map US 2017](https://kingcounty.gov/services/gis/Maps/imap.aspx) up on the blog for [King County GIS](https://www.kingcounty.gov/services/gis.aspx): [GIS & You](https://gisandyou.org/).

It's focused on how municipal government can benefit from and contribute to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).
