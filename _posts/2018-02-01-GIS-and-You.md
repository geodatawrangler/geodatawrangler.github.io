I've got a new article about my [trip to State of the Map US 2017](https://gisandyou.org/2018/01/31/public-data-meets-open-data/) up on the blog for [King County GIS](https://www.kingcounty.gov/services/gis.aspx: [GIS & You](https://gisandyou.org/).

It's focused on how municipal government can benefit from and contribute to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).
