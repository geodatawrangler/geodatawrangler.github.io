Just a quick note, to say I want to stop giving the effort I spend helping people use QGIS to Reddit to sell to the AI overlords. So I'm purposing my heart to put anything that I feel is useful on my blog, Even if it is published on Github (owned by one of the AI overlords), at least I control the domain and keep a copy of the information on my machine.

Problem, can I remember how this blog works? It's been almost 6 years since I posted anything. I guess if this is online, I remembered.
