The [PSQGIS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/puget-sound-qgis-users-group/) ran for a few years, bringing together users of the [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) free geographic information systems software in the Puget Sound area to learn and share information. Meeting in person from 2015 until  early 2020, and via Zoom until August 2023. Minutes were posted from the meetings until late 2019, along with a variety of resources, that while dated can still be helpful to some.  

## The Problem
The psqgis.org domain was released due to the ongoing cost and lack of traffic. Due to poor planning on my part, we lost web access to the content, which I would like to make available in as a static archive. The domain was subsequently picked up and redirected to a site apparently written in Italian. The source files to generate the site were still available on  [GitHub](https://github.com/psqgis/psqgis.github.io) but we could no longer access it via the GitHub URL. The GitHub URL was  redirected to the psqgis.org domain, which the was redirected by the new owner of the domain. To make things even more inconvenient, we also lost access to the GitHub account that owns the source repository as it has an email address in the psqgis.org domain, and logging in requires authentication via email to that address.

## The Saving Grace
Fortunately my GitHub account still has permission to merge pull requests on psqgis.github.io and I was able to remove the redirect from GitHub. So, at least for now, the content can be accessed at [psgis.github.io](https://psqgis.github.io/).
